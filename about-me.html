							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p>I started writing programs in 8th grade when my uncle, bought me an arduino. That little microcontroller opened my eyes to the world of programming by giving me immediate visable results of my code. Although the arduino sketches were based in c/c++ I never actually wrote a real command-line program until the next year when I took my first computer science class.</p>
							<p>My grandfather got his PHD in Computer Science and was one of the first developers for Texas Instruments. He is the reason I still code today. In My first CS class I was introduced to the basics in Java. But on my own time I re-wrote the examples in C++ for extra practice. This went on until my senior year until I gave up Java and C++ for Python.</p>
							<p>I had already made such great progress in C++ I was hesitant to give it up but I felt something was holding me back from making my own projects. And that maybe if I started over I would be able to find it myself. This came true with python. It is a simple yet powerful language that I have fallen in love with.</p>
